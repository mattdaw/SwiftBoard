SwiftBoard
==========

This is a personal project that I started so I could learn (and form an educated opinion about) Swift. I chose to re-implement some of the UI from iOS' SpringBoard.app because I admire the design, and it's a more complex and stateful UI than I had built on iOS. It has turned out to be a bigger project than I expected, but it has been a fun challenge. There's still more to do, and plenty of room for improvement... so I'm going to keep at it as I have time.

**Areas For Improvement**

- Drag and drop abstraction
- Clean up and simplify collection view layouts
- Unit tests
- Animation / transition polish

**Not Yet Implemented**

- Model layer / persistence
- Dragging an app on another app to create a folder
- Multiple pages of apps at the root level and in folders
